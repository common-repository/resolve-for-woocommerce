Resolve for WooCommerce.

== Description ==

Resolve, a comprehensive B2B credit management and net terms solution, brings net terms as a payment method to your checkout (lifts conversion rates) and boosts your cash flow by providing advance payment when you extend net terms to customers. We help you streamline your entire AR process including providing quick credit checks, net terms risk management, AR automation, payments and collections – so you can focus on growing your business.

With Resolve, you’ll receive up to 100% on net terms invoices within 1 day, allowing your customers to pay on 30/45/60 day terms for increased purchasing power. We handle payments, collections, and automate credit risk management – saving your accounting team valuable time and resources.

Our WooCommerce extension seamlessly integrates Net Terms into the checkout experience, offering customers 30-90 days to pay while ensuring you receive prompt payments.
